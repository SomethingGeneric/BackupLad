# BackupLad
Small backup script that can either copy folders by itself or when scheduled by cron or similar

## Usage:
* Windows:
  * `python backup.py` to configure a backup preset (ignore below if using it's own delay function)
  * `python backup.py` any other time to execute (makes it easy to schedule with cron)
* Anyone else:
  * `python3 backup.py` to configure a backup preset (ignore below if using it's own delay function)
  * `python backup.py` any other time to execute (makes it easy to schedule with cron)
